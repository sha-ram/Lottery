You are building a tool to let a user pick their numbers for a lottery.
A lottery ticket has four to eight numbers on it in the range 1-99. The order of the numbers matters.
 The user should be able to get a random selection, to replace a number, to remove a number (shifting the 
 ones afterwards downwards), to insert a number (shifting the ones afterwards upwards to make space), and 
 to print out their current numbers.
Use an array to store the currently-selected numbers. Create a text interface using a Scanner and System.in 
to allow the user to manipulate the numbers.
Let the user store a certain number of old tickets and retrieve them to use again.
Draw the lottery by picking random numbers and report whether the ticket won or not. You can decide what 
the winning criteria are.
